# ML-for-AirQuality
Clean air has a significant positive impact on several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as Good Health and Well-Being, Affordable and Clean Energy and an indirect impact on others.  Using Machine Learning , we can analyse and gain valuable insights on the air quality. 

There are many models and algorithms in Machine learning, each with their own perks. Here, I have implemented Naive Bayes Classifier , K - Nearest Neighbours (KNN) , Random forest  and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) . All from stracch.
